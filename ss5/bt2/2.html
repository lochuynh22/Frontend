    Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift and Fearless. "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and synth-pop on Red (2012) and fully embraced pop on 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums yielded successful singles like "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do".</p>
